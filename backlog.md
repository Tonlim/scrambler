# Backlog

- multiword support, including detecting existing and new words:
    - split input on newlines
    - run one-word-algorithm om each part
    - if any words are unknown, suggest a translation for each of them (with the three buttons)
    - if all words are known, display translated string
- UI: autosize to window instead of hiding stuff out of view, or add scrollbars
